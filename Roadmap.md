## COVID-19 DASHBOARD PROJECT

This roadmap outlines our development plan for the COVID-19 Dashboard Project. It is based on the delivery dates of our assignment in the course *Programming for Data Science* at the University of Bern.

The following deadlines and bullet points are mostly in order; however, the process may slightly vary due to unexpected issues or developer preferences.

---

### 1st Deadline – 17th of April

- The group is formed, and members are introduced to each other. Initial discussions were held about the next steps.
- The README file is created.
- The group has registered through ILIAS.
- The GitHub repository is created and uploaded.

---

### 2nd Deadline – 1st of May  
**First Deliverable + GitHub**

- The database will be downloaded and explored in depth so that meaningful data and effective visualizations can be extracted.
- Based on the extracted data and project requirements, each team member will be assigned their responsibilities (subject to change).
- After the raw datasets are examined, simple statistics (as stated in the assignment), such as deaths per case and the Rt number, will be calculated. Additionally, more statistics like Case Fatality Rate, Recovery Rate, Active Cases, etc., will also be determined.
- Once the meaningful statistics are defined, each member will be assigned a few metrics to compute and further process.
- The input system will be implemented, and a list of meaningful questions that users might ask will be created. Users will be able to select specific countries and a timespan.
- Depending on the availability of data, additional insights such as age, sex, hospitalization, etc., may also be analyzed.
- The selected data will be visualized whenever possible.
- Furthermore, trends such as infection and death rates across countries or regions, over time, and recovery comparisons will be developed.
- After each major code change, members will push their code, review the current progress, and discuss whether the project is on track.

### 3rd Deadline – 8th of May  
**Second Deliverable + Classes + Refactoring**

- Any unfinished parts from the previous deadline will be completed.
- The code will be refactored to follow object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, introducing classes and cleaner, more concise logic.
- Unnecessary code will be removed, and overall logic will be improved.
- The latest version will be uploaded to GitHub.

---

### 4th Deadline – 15th of May

- Unit tests will be written for key methods and computations.
- GitHub Issues will be created for any bugs or suggested improvements.
- Edge cases (e.g., missing data or incorrect inputs) will be tested and handled.

---

### 5th Deadline – 22nd of May

- Testing will be conducted in a controlled environment.
- Finalization of the codebase.
- Project presentation and submission of zipped files.

### Tools Expected to Be Used  
(*Note: Some tools may be added later depending on requirements.*)

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn
