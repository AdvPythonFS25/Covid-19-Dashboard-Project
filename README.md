## 🌍 Project Overview 

This project aims to create a reporting tool for the Covid-19 outbreak that allows users to explore cases and deaths across countries/regions at specific time spans using data from the [WHO’s Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho).
Users will be able to interact with data, view summary statistics, and explore trends through visualisations.
